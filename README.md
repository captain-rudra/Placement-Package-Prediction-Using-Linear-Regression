# Placement Package Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project predicts student placement packages based on CGPA using a supervised machine learning approach.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression model training
